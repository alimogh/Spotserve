# Spotserve
Android web server demo using NanoHTTPD through wifi hotspot/wifi network.

### Hosting the server:
You can host the web server on your android device by following one of the following two ways:

**Choice 1**

* Connect your server device to a wifi network.
* Client devices connected to the same wifi network, will be able to access the server.

**Choice 2**

* Turn on the hotspot on your server device.
* This way, the server will be hosted using the ip address of your server device's wireless access point. 
* Client devices can then access the web server by connecting to your server device's hotspot.
